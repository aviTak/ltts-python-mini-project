# Project Title: Text Editor GUI

In this repo, I will create a text editor GUI with Python that can create, open, edit, and save text files. We need three important widgets to create the desired text editor GUI with Python; 2 button widgets to save and close, and a text box widget to create and edit text files.

All the widgets should be arranged in a manner so that the buttons widgets are on the left side of the window layout and the text box widget is on the right side.

The entire window must have a minimum height of 800 pixels and the text box widget must have a minimum width of 800 pixels. The whole layout should be responsive so that if the window is resized, the text box widget is also resized.
