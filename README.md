All the widgets should be arranged in a manner so that the buttons widgets are on the left side of the window layout and the text box widget is on the right side.

The entire window must have a minimum height of 800 pixels and the text box widget must have a minimum width of 800 pixels. The whole layout should be responsive so that if the window is resized, the text box widget is also resized.
